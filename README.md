# Atomic Swap Contract Kit

Create customizable atomic swap contracts for Bitcoin compatible blockchains. This contract kit enables you to transact any type of data cross chain. It also enables you to transfer value between chains. As seen in the original [Atomic Swaps](https://github.com/DiviProject/atomic-swaps) implementation. The core goal is to be a flexible, easy to use smart contract platform. Mirroring functionality similar to other chains such as Ethereum and EOS.
